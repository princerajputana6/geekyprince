    quest: "Why should I work with you rather than my software development team?",
    ans: "Hiring your software engineers can be a wise decision; yet, the recruiting process is time-taking, and the costs of maintaining an in-house programming staff are prohibitively expensive. You’ll need to hire your own software developers at some point, but hiring us can save you a lot of money and time (which is the same in a business project).",

    quest: "What technology do you use?",

    quest: "Do they have an issue if you show interest in the development process?",
    ans: "In no way! We want you to feel confident that you’ll get your desired product. We welcome you to critique and enhance our work at every level, from conception to completion. The attitude of our team is to collaborate with the customer rather than just do assignments. We’re always willing to talk and listen.",
